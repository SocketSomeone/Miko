				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<h3>Last modified: April 28, 2021</h3>

				<p>
					We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise.
					Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management
					of the Miko. The use of the Internet pages of the Miko is possible
					without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject
					wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing
					of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal
					data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing,
					we generally obtain consent from the data subject. The processing of
					personal data subject shall always be in line with the General Data
					Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the
					country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Miko.
					By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would
					like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of
					the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data
					subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration,
					of the rights to which they are entitled. As the controller, the Miko
					has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to
					ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through
					this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in
					principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be
					guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer
					personal data to us via alternative means.
				</p>

				<h2>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>

				<p>We are a Data Controller of your information.</p>

				<p>
					Miko legal basis for collecting and using the personal information
					described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Information
					we collect and the specific context in which we collect the
					information:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Miko needs to perform a contract with you</li>
					<li>You have given Miko permission to do so</li>
					<li>
						Processing your personal information is in Miko legitimate interests
					</li>
					<li>Miko needs to comply with the law</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Miko will retain your personal information only for as long as is
					necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will
					retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with
					our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have
					certain data protection rights. If you wish to be informed what
					Personal Information we hold about you and if you want it to be
					removed from our systems, please contact us.
				</p>

				<p>
					In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection
					rights:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						The right to access, update or to delete the information we have on
						you.
					</li>
					<li>The right of rectification.</li>
					<li>The right to object.</li>
					<li>The right of restriction.</li>
					<li>The right to data portability</li>
					<li>The right to withdraw consent</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Cookies</h2>

				<p>
					The Internet pages of the Miko use cookies. Cookies are text files
					that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
				</p>

				<p>
					Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a
					so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.
					It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and
					servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the
					cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to
					differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other
					Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet
					browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
				</p>

				<p>
					Through the use of cookies, the Miko can provide the users of this
					website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible
					without the cookie setting.
				</p>

				<p>
					By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be
					optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously
					mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this
					recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The
					website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access
					data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by
					the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer
					system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online
					shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has
					placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.
				</p>

				<p>
					The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies
					through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the
					Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of
					cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time
					via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible
					in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the
					setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of
					our website may be entirely usable.
				</p>

				<p>
					For more general information on cookies, please read
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie"
						>"What Are Cookies" from Cookie Consent</a
					>.
